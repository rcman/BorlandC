This is MAN Borland C code. I make no garentees it works. The source is not written well and does not exit well.

What can I say I was learning.  The graphics were made with the Draw Program in the other repository.

I will upload what I can, I have a lot of code that is all over the place.


Download the Virtual Machine disk files from here and you should be able to compile this.

Thanks
